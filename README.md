# OOP ASSIGNMENT

## encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It helps protect the internal state of an object by restricting direct access to some of its components.

## inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to acquire properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

## polymorphism
Polymorphism means “many forms” and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (e.g., method overloading and overriding).

## abstraction
Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps reduce complexity and increases efficiency by exposing only relevant parts of the code.
